# Dicee
"Dicee" is a dice game between two players.
 When the user loads the web page, it displays two dice images with labels for player 1 and player 2.

When the user refreshes the page, the dice images are randomly generated using JavaScript. The JavaScript code generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, which correspond to the faces of the dice. The code then selects the appropriate dice image for each player and updates the HTML code to display the new images.

After the dice images are generated, the JavaScript code compares the two random numbers to determine the winner. If player 1 has a higher number than player 2, the message "Player 1 wins" is displayed. If player 2 has a higher number, the message "Player 2 wins" is displayed. If both players have the same number, the message "Draw!" is displayed.

Overall, this web application is a simple game that demonstrates the use of JavaScript to generate random numbers and update HTML elements based on the results.
